        How Signature Generation Works
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={{ lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
        The signature generation workflow is designed to be intuitive and fast. Start by entering
        the text you want to convert into a signature. Our signature generation engine processes
        your input and displays it in real-time using your selected font. As you adjust settings
        like font size, color, and background, the signature generation preview updates
        instantly. Once you're satisfied with your signature, the generation process allows you to
        export it in multiple formats. PNG export is perfect for documents and presentations,
        while SVG export provides vector graphics that scale perfectly at any size.

        Best Practices for Signature Generation
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={{ lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
        To get the best results from signature generation, consider these recommendations. First,
        choose a font that matches your natural handwriting style or professional needs. Our
        signature generation tool offers fonts ranging from elegant script styles to more formal
        serif options. Second, ensure your signature generation output has appropriate sizing for
        its intended use. For email signatures, smaller sizes work well, while document signatures
        may require larger dimensions. Third, when using signature generation for professional
        documents, consider using transparent backgrounds to maintain document formatting.

        Signature Generation Formats Explained
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={{ lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
        Our signature generation platform supports two export formats, each with distinct
        advantages. PNG format from signature generation provides raster images with excellent
        quality for most applications. This signature generation output works well in documents,
        presentations, and web applications. SVG format from signature generation creates vector
        graphics that maintain perfect quality at any resolution. This signature generation option
        is ideal when you need to scale your signature for different document sizes or print
        materials. Both signature generation formats preserve your customization choices,
        including colors, fonts, and textures.

        Troubleshooting Common Signature Generation Issues
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={{ lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
        If you encounter issues during signature generation, here are some solutions. If your
        exported signature appears black, it's likely because your image viewer has a dark
        background. Try opening the signature generation output in a different application or
        place it over a light-colored document. For best signature generation results, ensure
        your text input isn't empty before exporting. The signature generation tool validates
        input to prevent empty exports. If you need to reset your signature generation settings,
        use the reset button to return to default configurations.
